# end2end-pytorch
This repository contains the necessary functions  to implement the experiments presented in  [paper](https://arxiv.org/abs/1708.09427) "Deep Learning to Improve Breast Cancer Detection on Screening Mammography" in Pytorch.The original code is implemented on Tensorflow. You can find the original repository [here](https://github.com/lishen/end2end-all-conv).

A end-to-end code example of this framework can be found [here](https://github.com/sposso/end_2_end_model)
